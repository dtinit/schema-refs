# AI Conversation History Export

This format is intended for interoperable export/import of AI conversation history.
It may be useful in personal data portability scenarios, where a user wishing to 
transfer their history to a new service can have the new service ingest their 
conversation history with a previous service.  It may also be useful simply for 
users to back up their important conversations.

## Using this format

All senders of messages in the "messages" section are identified in the "identifiers"
section, except "AI" if there is only one AI in the conversation.

Comments and suggestions may be sent to DTI via dtinit.org.
